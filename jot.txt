Novelty:
- Dataset is digitally produced
- Edge connectivity represents information
- High frequency with 128 timesteps per second
- Very repetitive and consistent with the same openings and objectives every time

Rigor:
- idk

Explainability:
- Spatiotemporal positional data can be easily visualized with matplotlib
- FPS video games provide a first-person view in a shooting video game with kills and deaths
- The attacking team aims to control space on map, and the defending team opposes them

Negatives
- Illegal positional coordinates may be generated for players
